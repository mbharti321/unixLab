Explaination:
1.  c = in this program the child process is writing the string hello world at the end of pipe (f[1]) 
      and sending it to parent process and which is reading it from pipe(f[0]). Mainly in this program 
      both process are inter-communicating.

2.  c =in this program first it is taking 10 strings from the user and the child process is writing 
      the all the string in the end of pipe (p[1]) and sending it to parent process and which is reading
      it from pipe(p[0]). Then the strings is being sorted by strcmp() and strcpy() and at the end it is printing.
3.  c = in this program, first a child process is opening the file d.txt in write only mode and
      writing in that file the string called “hello world” in the end of pipe (fp[1]) and sending 
      it to parent process and parent process first opening file in read only mode and  reading it
      from pipe(fp[0]) and printing that. It printing id of both the process as well.
